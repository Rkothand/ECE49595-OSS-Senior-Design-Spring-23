Over the last few weeks and this week in particular we are preparing code for our large pull request that we would like to get approved. The majority of our changes is updating the gym functionality with gymnasium. These changes consist of changing data being inputed into the newly added gymnasium functions and then updating the algorithms that used gym data output. Additionally we have been able to make changes to how data input and saving to devices are done which are some minor efficiency improvements.
