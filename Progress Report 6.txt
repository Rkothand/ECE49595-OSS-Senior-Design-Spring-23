Inline with this being the final progress report of the semester, 
We have begun to package our Github Repository in working states to ensure that our deliverable is met. We have had 2 pull requests approved over the course of this semester, one which we had approved before the midterm progess review and another one recently. Overall we are able to make a sizeable scale migration of gymnasium functionality over the previous gym functionality. Additionally we were able to make use of tools that made vectorization possible and as a result the improve overall efficiency of the Machine learning algorithm.
