We are currently working on improving the Dreamer MBRL Machine Learning Algorithm and bringing it up to date with more modern technologies. 
The primary usage of the MBRL lib is to make the reinforcement learing easier by generating an environment a list of vectors and as a result all the calculations are run in a lighter environment to make all algorithms faster and more efficient.
We are doing this in form of implementing the technologies gymnasium, hydra, and dm-control in the existling mbrl-lib.
