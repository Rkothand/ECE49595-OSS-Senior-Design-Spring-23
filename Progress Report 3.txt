Overall things are going quite well in our project, I have gotten in pace with my teammates and am contirbuting to the main forked repo in our teams name. We have begun to migrate Gymnasium compatibility to replace the existing gym functionality and incorporate the additional data values that Gymnasium gives over the original Gym. Additionally our fork and merge of the test models for Gaussian and mlp was approved where we modified the device types.
